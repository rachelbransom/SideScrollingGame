 - Date started Friday 09/02 - Wednesday 09/14
 - Only main was used to start the project
 - Nothing was used to test the project
 - The only resources that are required by the program are the images in the background of level 1, level 2 and the splash screen.

**Cheat Codes:**

*For level 1:*
**T** to pass the level and skip to the next (collect 10 coins)
**E** to disable all the enemies

*For level 2:*
**T** for the winning star to come onto the screen to win the game
**E** to disable all the enemies

 - No known bugs, crashes or problems with the project's functionality, other than those discussed in the analysis (no serious bugs)
 - No extra features were included in the project
 - I felt this assignment required a great deal of time and effort, butI found it incredibly rewarding.
